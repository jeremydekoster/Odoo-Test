# Odoo-Test
Odoo Test- Bootstrap Card Component

1째 Variant A: Most of the requirements are OK. It remains a few non-variables in the custom.css file, mainly for the height of the .card and for the 20px rule. There's also a bug on the loader in the Tab 2. This one is corrected in the Variant B.

2째 Variant B: I tried to improve (slightly) the design and the usability of the component.

3째 Variant C: Unfortunately, I tried hard but I cannot make the mixin working, I don't know why. My apologies... But I'll keep trying and update the file if I find the solution. Every problem has his solution ;)
